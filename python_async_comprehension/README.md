# Async Python Project
## Overview
This project contains a series of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of asynchronous programming in Python. The scripts are designed to showcase asynchronous generators, comprehensions, and parallel execution using asyncio.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 (This project is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS)
- Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Adherence to pycodestyle (PEP 8) coding style, version 2.5.x

## Project Structure
The project is composed of three tasks, each building upon the previous one:

### Task 0: Async Generator
- File: 0-async_generator.py
- Function: async_generator() -> Generator[float, None, None]
- Description: This coroutine generates 10 random floating-point numbers asynchronously, each between 0 and 10. The coroutine waits 1 second before yielding each number.

Usage

import asyncio
from 0-async_generator import async_generator

async def print_yielded_values():
    async for number in async_generator():
        print(number)

asyncio.run(print_yielded_values())

### Task 1: Async Comprehension
- File: 1-async_comprehension.py
- Function: async_comprehension() -> List[float]
- Description: This coroutine collects 10 random numbers from the async_generator using an asynchronous list comprehension, and returns the list of numbers.

Usage

import asyncio
from 1-async_comprehension import async_comprehension

async def main():
    result = await async_comprehension()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())

### Task 2: Measure Runtime
- File: 2-measure_runtime.py
- Function: measure_runtime() -> float
- Description: This coroutine measures the total runtime of executing async_comprehension four times in parallel using asyncio.gather. The expected runtime is approximately 10 seconds because the four coroutines run concurrently.

Usage

import asyncio
from 2-measure_runtime import measure_runtime

async def main():
    runtime = await measure_runtime()
    print(f"Total runtime: {runtime} seconds")

asyncio.run(main())

## Expected Outputs
- Task 0: Prints 10 random numbers, each approximately 1 second apart.
- Task 1: Prints a list of 10 random numbers generated by async_comprehension.
- Task 2: Prints the total runtime of running async_comprehension four times in parallel, which should be roughly 10 seconds.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.7 installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
4. Run each script using the python3 command:

python3 0-main.py
python3 1-main.py
python3 2-main.py

## Coding Style
All scripts adhere to the pycodestyle (PEP 8) guidelines. You can check the style compliance using:

pycodestyle 0-async_generator.py
pycodestyle 1-async_comprehension.py
pycodestyle 2-measure_runtime.py
