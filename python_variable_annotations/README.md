# Python - Variable Annotations 

This repository is part of the **holbertonschool-web_back_end** curriculum and focuses on the use of Python variable annotations. The goal of this project is to introduce and practice using type annotations in Python, a feature that allows developers to specify the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values, making code easier to understand and debug.

## Description
Type annotations in Python are a way to explicitly state the type of variables and function return types. They help in improving code readability, enable better debugging, and provide a way for static type checkers like **mypy** to verify the types. This project covers several fundamental tasks that require the implementation of functions with type annotations, dealing with data types like integers, floats, strings, lists, and tuples.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and apply type annotations in Python.
- Implement type-annotated functions that handle various data types.
- Recognize the benefits of type annotations in improving code quality.
- Utilize Python's typing module to enforce type constraints in functions.

## Requirements
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Python Version**: Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Python Style Guide**: pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- **File Executability**: All files must be executable.
- **File Structure**: Each file must end with a new line, and the first line should be **#!/usr/bin/python3**.
